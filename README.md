# Warning 

This code base is currently being assembled. Much of the functionality is untested and much of it is not yet implemented.

# lamda
A Lua functional library inspired by Ramda and Underscore. And no, the name is not misspelled. It is taken from my favorite JavaScript functional library Ramda, thus (L)ua R(amda).

In the process of building this library it will stay as consistent as possible to the interface provided by Ramda and Underscore, taking many of the names from Underscore but always using the convention from Ramda of placing the arguments in the best order for currying. To understand the motivation for this see the video: [Hey Underscore, You're Doing it Wrong!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3svKOdZijA).
