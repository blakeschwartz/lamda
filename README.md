# lamda
A Lua functional library inspired by Ramda and Underscore. And no, the name is not misspelled. It is taken from my favorite JavaScript functional library Ramda, thus (L)ua R(amda).

In the process of building this library it will stay as consistent as possible to the interface provided by Ramda.
